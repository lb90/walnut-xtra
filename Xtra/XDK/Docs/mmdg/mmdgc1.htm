<H3>Multimedia Xtras Overview</H3>
<HR width=45% align=left>
<P> Using the Multimedia Xtra API, you can develop four types of Xtras,
  all supported by Director:<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Transition Xtras</B> are a type of asset that provide ways
  to customize the changes from one part of a presentation to another.
  Transition Xtras are presented to the author through the standard
  UI of the host application. Transitions can combine visual change
  elements with sounds and other media. <A HREF="mmdgc2.htm">&quot;Asset Xtras&quot;</A> describes the Transition Xtra API. <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Sprite Xtras</B> are a type of asset that provide customized
  interactive behavior in multimedia presentations. In Director,
  sprites can represent themselves in both the cast and score of
  a movie. Sprite Xtras can display themselves in a multimedia
  piece, interact with user actions such as mouse clicks and key
  presses, and respond to both standard and custom properties and
  functions in the application's native scripting language. <A HREF="mmdgc2.htm">&quot;Asset Xtras&quot;</A> describes the Sprite Xtra API. <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Scripting Xtras</B> provide ways to extend the capabilities
  of Lingo in Director to include new
  functionality. Scripting Xtras are a cross-product extension of
  the Lingo Xtras supported in Director 5.0. Using the Director
  services API, Scripting Xtras can control presentations
  and manipulate their content. In Director, Scripting Xtras can
  be combined with movies in a window to provide complete custom
  behavior and user interfaces. <A HREF="mmdgc3.htm">&quot;Scripting Xtras&quot;</A> describes the Scripting Xtra API. <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Tool Xtras</B> provide a way to display arbitrary windows presenting
  tools fo manipulating Director features at author time. Like Scripting
  Xtras, Tools can use the Director API to control
  the features of a presentation. Tool Xtras are displayed in the
  Xtras menu, and are supported in the Director authoring
  applications, not in players. <A HREF="mmdgc4.htm">&quot;Tool Xtras&quot;</A> describes the Tool Xtra API. <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Filter Xtras</B> provide a way to apply filtering to sprite images that are being displayed on the stage.
  Filters were introduced in Director 11.
  Information about a specific sprite filter and its properties is saved in the score data for the sprite.
  The filter properties that can be specified with a VDL file so that they are settable with the Director User Interface.
  Filters can be assigned using some scripting commands as well.
  Using the filter <a href="../mmref/mmxfilter.htm">interface</a> you can develop custom filter operations.
 <BR>
<P> <A HREF="mmdgtg.htm" >&quot;Tips, Guidelines, and Gotchas&quot;</A> describes some useful details to be aware of when coding Xtras
  for Director.
