<h3>MOA (Macromedia Open Architecture) Developer's Guide </h3>
<HR width=45% align=left>
<h3><A NAME="RTFToC1">Introduction</A> </h3>
<DL>
  <DT>
  <DD>The Macromedia Open Architecture (MOA) provides a unified
    mechanism for implementing code extensions--Xtras--to enhance
    the capabilities of MOA-based applications. MOA allows Xtras
    for all applications to conform to a single set of programming
    constructs and conventions.
    <P> The MOA object model is derived from the Microsoft Component Object
      Model (COM), used to implement OLE (Object Linking and Embedding).
      However, while COM is designed as a universal, system-level object
      model, MOA is intended to be more task-specific. The scope of
      MOA is those areas within Adobe applications that can benefit
      from runtime extensions. The purpose of MOA is to provide a consistent,
      modular way to define and implement those extensions. This restriction
      benefits MOA programmers by allowing them to focus on specific
      features rather than learning a large, general purpose system.
    <P> MOA is in one sense a subset of COM, and MOA objects are binary
      compatible with COM. However, no effort has been made to implement
      all features of COM, such as certain interfaces required by OLE
      objects. If you're familiar with COM, you should find many similarities
      in this discussion. If you're not familiar with COM, this discussion
      provides all the background you need to understand MOA. <BR>

<h4><A NAME="RTFToC2">MOA and XDKs</A> </h4>
<DL>
  <DT>
  <DD>While MOA provides the general mechanism and some standard
    API for implementing Xtras, specific Xtra functionality is implemented
    through task-specific API. This API is developed in conjunction
    with specific Adobe applications, and is made available through
    Xtra Development Kits (XDKs) as the applications supporting these
    Xtras become available. <BR>

<h3><A NAME="RTFToC3">About this document</A> </h3>
<DL>
  <DT>
  <DD>This document provides a general introduction to MOA. It supplements
    the documentation for task and application-specific API provided
    with an XDK. This document provides an overview of MOA and general
    guidelines for coding MOA Xtras. <BR>
    <BR>
    <UL>
      <LI><A HREF="moadgc1.htm" >&quot;MOA Technical Concepts&quot;</A> discusses concepts of the MOA object model, covering the general
        relationship between applications and Xtras. <BR>
        <BR>
      <LI><A HREF="moadgc2.htm" >&quot;Implementing MOA Xtras&quot;</A> provides an example of how to code an Xtra using MOA, ending with
        a summary of MOA API and calling conventions. <BR>
        <BR>
      <LI><A HREF="moadgc3.htm" >&quot;MOA Development Issues&quot;</A> describes some MOA programming details, including platform-specific
        and compiler-specific issues.<BR>
        <BR>
      <LI><A HREF="../moref/index.htm" >&quot;MOA Interfaces&quot;</A> describes
        the general MOA interfaces provided for implementing Xtras. <A HREF="../moref/momthndx.htm" >&quot;MOA Methods&quot;</A> provides an alphabetical listing of the methods of these interfaces.<BR>
        <BR>
      <LI><A HREF="../moref/motypndx.htm" >&quot;MOA Types and Miscellaneous API&quot;</A> lists the types, constants, error codes, and other API provided
        by MOA. <BR>
        <BR>
      <LI><A HREF="moadgtg.htm" >&quot;Tips, Guidelines, and Gotchas&quot;</A> includes some general techniques useful in implementing Xtras.
    </UL>
    <P> This documentation also includes a <A HREF="moadggl.htm" >glossary</A> and a list of <A HREF="moadgfaq.htm" >frequently asked questions</A> about MOA.</P>

  <DD>Throughout, this document assumes an understanding of basic
    programming concepts. Examples and reference material require
    familiarity with the C programming language. <BR>

<h5><A NAME="RTFToC4">Note on type conventions </A> </h5>
<DL>
  <DT>
  <DD>The following type conventions are used throughout this document: <BR>
    <BR>
    <I>Italic type</I> is used to identify new terms where they are
    defined. <BR>
    <BR>
    <span class="code">Courier font</span> is used
    to identify code fragments and API literals, including class names,
    method names, function names, type names, macros. <BR>
    <BR>
    <span class="code"><I>Italic Courier font</I></span> is used to identify parameters to functions and methods.
