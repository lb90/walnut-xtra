  <DT>
  <DD><B>Class</B>: A unit of implementation of one or more MOA
    interfaces, corresponding to a class in other object models. The
    class defines implementations for each method in its interfaces,
    and provides ways to create and destroy the objects that provide
    those implementations. In addition, the class defines a private
    data structure--instance variables--accessible only within method
    implementations.<BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Interface</B>: A unit of interaction specified as a set of
    function prototypes or methods. An interface is designed to provide
    a template through which a provider and a user of the interface
    can interact. An interface defines the names, argument types,
    and return types for all its methods. It is identified by an interface
    identifier, a 128 place integer that uniquely represents the interface
    in code. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Instance variable</B>: A member of a private data structure
    belonging to an object. The instance variables for a particular
    class of objects are accessible only within the method implementations
    for the interfaces of the class. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Method</B>: function prototype that specifies the name, calling
    sequence, argument types, and return types for a specific procedure
    of an interface. The functions prototyped within an interface
    are referred to as its methods. The methods represent the actual
    name binding of the function call: this name binding is independent
    of the actual name used by a class for the method implementation. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Method implementation</B>: a function that represents the implementation
    of a specific method. A class definition specifies a name binding
    from each method defined in an interface to the corresponding
    method implementation in the class. In most cases, method implementations
    are given a name consisting of the class name, and underbar, and
    the method name; for example MyClass_MyMethod<BR>
    <BR>
    <B>MoaID</B>: A 128 place integer type used to identify interfaces
    and classes defined in MOA. Each interface and each class is assigned
    its own unique MoaID when it is defined. These identifiers are
    used within a program to identify and interact with a particular
    interface or class. The MoaID for an interface is referred to
    as its IID, or Interface Identifier. The MoaID for a class is
    referred to as its CLSID, or Class Identifier.<BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Object</B>: A unit of behavior, providing a specific set of
    interfaces implemented by a class. Within its method implementations,
    the object has access to the private data of its instance variables.
    Externally, the only &quot;visible&quot; aspect of an object is
    its collection of behaviors: the methods defined by its interfaces. <BR>
